## Installation and Updating
For manual installation, go to  **Themes -> Open CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash**  and enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuckFire/BottomBar
```

Powercords updater is currently broken, so in order to update the theme you will have to do it manually. To do it manually, go to **Themes -> BottomBar -> Open CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash**, and enter the following:
```
git pull
```

## Other Support Installation
If you're using Revert Discord and would like to use Bottom Bar, go to **Themes -> Open CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash**  and enter the following:

## Credits 
Thank you to Hoofer for helping me get the bottom area below the members list colored as well as finding multiple issues because I am super stupid.
